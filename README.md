# Takeaway

## Overview
A version of [Tightens Takeout](https://github.com/tighten/takeout) built using Golang.

## Why build this?
Tightens version is built using PHP and requires PHP to be installed on the machine. It can also be a bit slow to startup.

A Golang based version can be compiled into native code so it doesn't require anything else to be installed on the machine and the startup time is greatly reduced.

I also just wanted to test my Golang knowledge with a project I was familiar with.
